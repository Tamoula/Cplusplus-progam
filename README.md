# Cplusplus-progam Project Two Airgead Banking
•	Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  The purpose of the project was to develop an object oriented code(OOP).  The code was used to calulate money invested in an account using interest rate, monthly deposit, and amount of     years.
  
•	What did you do particularly well?
  I felt the overall code was done well.  The display was appropriate to the assignment.
  
•	Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
  The project adequately met all requirements.  As far as improvements, I don't feel any are needed at this time since the code was efficient and secure.
  
•	Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
  Learning how to code the display was my biggest challenge. I was able to use zybooks and also YouTube. There are previous SNHU professors who do videos to help with projects. 
  
•	What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
  The skills I think will help in future projects is the display menu.  Having been able to adequately code and display my work. 
  
•	How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  The program is maintable, readable, and adpatable, one because its follows a consistent coding style. Two functions and classes are kept small and focused. Three it is commented efficently. The code was tested efficently.
